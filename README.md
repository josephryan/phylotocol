# phylotocol
*template, example, and instructions on how to make an a priori phylogenetic protocol*

### About

The rationale for *phylotocol* is to provide general guidelines and a very generic template for researchers to document *a priori* planned phylogenetic analyses as well as changes to the original protocol through updated versioning. The concept is modeled after clinical trial protocols. The original template is modeled after the NIH clinical trial template available here: http://osp.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/Protocol-Template-Version-1.0-040717.docx   

It is intended that a *phylotocol* would be posted to a public repository like GitHub or FigShare immediately after it is completed, and that a DOI or link to the document would be provided in any publications that resulted from the proposed analyses. it is highly recommended to post the phylotocol on a public site that will provide a timestamp.

A *phylotocol* adds transparency to the process of phylogenetic analysis. It allows readers of a phylogenetic study to understand the original rationale for a study. It forces any changes (e.g., removal of taxa, change in methods, etc.) to be accompanied by explicit justification. In this way, it helps reduce confirmation bias, and allows outsiders to assess the work rather than assume that the reported results were influenced by confirmation bias. 

### Justifying the time and effort

A *phylotocol* can be very helpful in planning a study. It helps trainees organize their work and provides an opportunity for mentees to provide feedback early in the study. It provides a clear set of tasks that can then be divided between collaborators. It can be helpful for assessing computational needs for the project. It can help establish expected timelines for completing particular tasks. It can also serve as the text of methods or extended methods in a publication.

### Public comment

Public comment is very important for the success of *phylotocol*. Please do not hesitate to post ideas, concerns, requests, etc. as an [issue](https://github.com/josephryan/phylotocol/issues) on this GitHub repository.

### Instructions

It is important to incorporate all sections of the template into your *phylotocol* and to do so in the same order. If a particular section is not applicable to your study, include it, but indicate that it is not applicable.

Example text is included to further aid in *phylotocol* writing and can be modified to suit the study or deleted. Within example text, a need for insertion of specific information is notated by \<angle brackets\>.  

Version control is important to track *phylotocol* development, revisions, and amendments.  With each revision, the version number and date located on the cover page and in the footer of each page should be updated.  When making changes to a released *phylotocol*, the amendment history should be maintained (see Section 5 PHYLOTOCOL AMENDMENT HISTORY). All versions should be published with the study. 

### Example

An example of a project that uses *phylotocol* is available [here](https://github.com/josephryan/2017-SpongeParaHoxAnalyses/).
